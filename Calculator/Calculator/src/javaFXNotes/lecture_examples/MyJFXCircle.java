/*This is an example of a JavaFX Circle class that will create any type of 
  Circle object which you can return to your start method to be utilized.
  
  Again, whenever your working on your homework and game project, make sure
  to think about how you can split up your Backend and Frontend code into 
  methods or classes since GUI will continue to become more complex and 
  we do not want Backend and Frontend code to break one another
  
  Ex) You can add this circle object component to your panel and access
  	  this component along with its methods*/
